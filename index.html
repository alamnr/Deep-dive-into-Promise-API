Complex async code made easier

Right, let's code some things. Say we want to:

    Start a spinner to indicate loading
    Fetch some JSON for a story, which gives us the title, and urls for each chapter
    Add title to the page
    Fetch each chapter
    Add the story to the page
    Stop the spinner
    
    but also tell the user if something went wrong along the way. We'll want to stop the spinner at that point too, else it'll keep on spinning, get dizzy, and crash into some other UI.

Of course, you wouldn't use JavaScript to deliver a story, serving as HTML is faster, but this pattern is pretty common when dealing with APIs: Multiple data fetches, then do something when it's all done.

To start with, let's deal with fetching data from the network:
*/

function get(url){
  
  // return a new Promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    // Do the unusual XHR stuff
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open('GET',url);
    
    req.onload = function(){
      // this is called even on 404
      //  so check the status
      if(req.status==200){
        // resolve the promise with the response text
        resolve(req.response);
      }
      else{
        // otherwise  reject with the status text
        // which will hopefully be a meaningfull error
        reject(Error(req.statusText));
      }
    };
    // Handle network errors
    req.onerror = function() {
      reject(Error("Network Error"));
    };

    // Make the request
    req.send();

  });
 
}

get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
}, function(error) {
  console.error("Failed!", error);
})

/*
Now we can make HTTP requests without manually typing XMLHttpRequest, which is great, because the less I have to see the infuriating camel-casing of XMLHttpRequest, the happier my life will be.

Chaining

then() isn't the end of the story, you can chain thens together to transform values or run additional async actions one after another.
*/

/*

Transforming values

You can transform values simply by returning the new value:

*/

var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    resolve(1);
});

promise.then(value=>{
    console.log(val);  // 1
    return val+2;
}).then(val=>{
    console.log(val);  // 3
})

get('story.json').then(res=>console.log('Success, '+res))

/*
get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
})

The response is JSON, but we're currently receiving it as plain text. We could alter our get function to use the JSON responseType, but we could also solve it in promises land:
*/


get('story.json').then(res=>{
    // get plain text as response here and then transform in to JSON
    return JSON.parse(res);
}).then(data=>{
    // here in this chainable then we receive the transformed json
    console.log('Yea! JSON-'  , data); 
})  

/*
get('story.json').then(JSON.parse).then(function(response) {
  console.log("Yey JSON!", response);
}) */



//In fact, we could make a getJSON() function really easily:

function getJSON(url) {
  return get(url).then(JSON.parse);
}

/*
getJSON() still returns a promise, one that fetches a url then parses the response as JSON.
*/

/*  
Queuing asynchronous actions

You can also chain thens to run async actions in sequence.

When you return something from a then() callback, it's a bit magic. If you return a value, the next then() is called with that value. However, if you return something promise-like, the next then() waits on it, and is only called when that promise settles (succeeds/fails). For example:

getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {
  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);
}).then(function(chapter1) {
  console.log("Got chapter 1!", chapter1);
})

Here we make an async request to story.json, which gives us a set of URLs to request, then we request the first of those. This is when promises really start to stand out from simple callback patterns.

You could even make a shortcut method to get chapters:

You could even make a shortcut method to get chapters:

var storyPromise;

function getChapter(i) {
  storyPromise = storyPromise || getJSON('story.json');

  return storyPromise.then(function(story) {
    return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[i]);
  })
}

// and using it is simple:
getChapter(0).then(function(chapter) {
  console.log(chapter);
  return getChapter(1);
}).then(function(chapter) {
  console.log(chapter);
})

We don't download story.json until getChapter is called, but the next time(s) getChapter is called we reuse the story promise, so story.json is only fetched once. Yay Promises!

Error handling

As we saw earlier, then() takes two arguments, one for success, one for failure (or fulfill and reject, in promises-speak):

get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
}, function(error) {
  console.log("Failed!", error);
})

You can also use catch():

get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.log("Failed!", error);
})

There's nothing special about catch(), it's just sugar for then(undefined, func), but it's more readable. Note that the two code examples above do not behave the same, the latter is equivalent to:

get('story.json').then(function(response) {
  console.log("Success!", response);
}).then(undefined, function(error) {
  console.log("Failed!", error);
})

The difference is subtle, but extremely useful. Promise rejections skip forward to the next then() with a rejection callback (or catch(), since it's equivalent). With then(func1, func2), func1 or func2 will be called, never both. But with then(func1).catch(func2), both will be called if func1 rejects, as they're separate steps in the chain. Take the following:

asyncThing1().then(function() {
  return asyncThing2();
}).then(function() {
  return asyncThing3();
}).catch(function(err) {
  return asyncRecovery1();
}).then(function() {
  return asyncThing4();
}, function(err) {
  return asyncRecovery2();
}).catch(function(err) {
  console.log("Don't worry about it");
}).then(function() {
  console.log("All done!");
})

The flow above is very similar to normal JavaScript try/catch, errors that happen within a "try" go immediately to the catch() block. Here's the above as a flowchart (because I love flowcharts):
*/

/*
JavaScript exceptions and promises

Rejections happen when a promise is explicitly rejected, but also implicitly if an error is thrown in the constructor callback:

var jsonPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // JSON.parse throws an error if you feed it some
  // invalid JSON, so this implicitly rejects:
  resolve(JSON.parse("This ain't JSON"));
});

jsonPromise.then(function(data) {
  // This never happens:
  console.log("It worked!", data);
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Instead, this happens:
  console.log("It failed!", err);
})

This means it's useful to do all your promise-related work inside the promise constructor callback, so errors are automatically caught and become rejections.

The same goes for errors thrown in then() callbacks.

get('/').then(JSON.parse).then(function() {
  // This never happens, '/' is an HTML page, not JSON
  // so JSON.parse throws
  console.log("It worked!", data);
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Instead, this happens:
  console.log("It failed!", err);
})

Error handling in practice

With our story and chapters, we can use catch to display an error to the user:

getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {
  return getJSON(story.chapterUrls[0]);
}).then(function(chapter1) {
  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);
}).catch(function() {
  addTextToPage("Failed to show chapter");
}).then(function() {
  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';
})

If fetching story.chapterUrls[0] fails (e.g., http 500 or user is offline), it'll skip all following success callbacks, which includes the one in getJSON() which tries to parse the response as JSON, and also skips the callback that adds chapter1.html to the page. Instead it moves onto the catch callback. As a result, "Failed to show chapter" will be added to the page if any of the previous actions failed.

Like JavaScript's try/catch, the error is caught and subsequent code continues, so the spinner is always hidden, which is what we want. The above becomes a non-blocking async version of:

try {
  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');
  var chapter1 = getJSONSync(story.chapterUrls[0]);
  addHtmlToPage(chapter1.html);
}
catch (e) {
  addTextToPage("Failed to show chapter");
}
document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'

You may want to catch() simply for logging purposes, without recovering from the error. To do this, just rethrow the error. We could do this in our getJSON() method:

function getJSON(url) {
  return get(url).then(JSON.parse).catch(function(err) {
    console.log("getJSON failed for", url, err);
    throw err;
  });
}

So we've managed to fetch one chapter, but we want them all. Let's make that happen.


Parallelism and sequencing: getting the best of both

Thinking async isn't easy. If you're struggling to get off the mark, try writing the code as if it were synchronous. In this case:

try {
  var story = getJSONSync('story.json');
  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);

  story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {
    var chapter = getJSONSync(chapterUrl);
    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
  });

  addTextToPage("All done");
}
catch (err) {
  addTextToPage("Argh, broken: " + err.message);
}

document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none'

Try it

That works (see code)! But it's sync and locks up the browser while things download. To make this work async we use then() to make things happen one after another.

getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {
  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);

  // TODO: for each url in story.chapterUrls, fetch &amp; display
}).then(function() {
  // And we're all done!
  addTextToPage("All done");
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Catch any error that happened along the way
  addTextToPage("Argh, broken: " + err.message);
}).then(function() {
  // Always hide the spinner
  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';
})

But how can we loop through the chapter urls and fetch them in order? This doesn't work:

story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {
  // Fetch chapter
  getJSON(chapterUrl).then(function(chapter) {
    // and add it to the page
    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
  });
})

forEach isn't async-aware, so our chapters would appear in whatever order they download, which is basically how Pulp Fiction was written. This isn't Pulp Fiction, so let's fix it.

Creating a sequence

We want to turn our chapterUrls array into a sequence of promises. We can do that using then():

// Start off with a promise that always resolves
var sequence = Promise.resolve();

// Loop through our chapter urls
story.chapterUrls.forEach(function(chapterUrl) {
  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence
  sequence = sequence.then(function() {
    return getJSON(chapterUrl);
  }).then(function(chapter) {
    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
  });
})

This is the first time we've seen Promise.resolve(), which creates a promise that resolves to whatever value you give it. If you pass it an instance of Promise it'll simply return it (note: this is a change to the spec that some implementations don't yet follow). If you pass it something promise-like (has a then() method), it creates a genuine Promise that fulfills/rejects in the same way. If you pass in any other value, e.g., Promise.resolve('Hello'), it creates a promise that fulfills with that value. If you call it with no value, as above, it fulfills with "undefined".

There's also Promise.reject(val), which creates a promise that rejects with the value you give it (or undefined).

We can tidy up the above code using array.reduce:

// Loop through our chapter urls
story.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {
  // Add these actions to the end of the sequence
  return sequence.then(function() {
    return getJSON(chapterUrl);
  }).then(function(chapter) {
    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
  });
}, Promise.resolve())

This is doing the same as the previous example, but doesn't need the separate "sequence" variable. Our reduce callback is called for each item in the array. "sequence" is Promise.resolve() the first time around, but for the rest of the calls "sequence" is whatever we returned from the previous call. array.reduce is really useful for boiling an array down to a single value, which in this case is a promise.

Let's put it all together:

getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {
  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);

  return story.chapterUrls.reduce(function(sequence, chapterUrl) {
    // Once the last chapter's promise is done…
    return sequence.then(function() {
      // …fetch the next chapter
      return getJSON(chapterUrl);
    }).then(function(chapter) {
      // and add it to the page
      addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
    });
  }, Promise.resolve());
}).then(function() {
  // And we're all done!
  addTextToPage("All done");
}).catch(function(err) {
  // Catch any error that happened along the way
  addTextToPage("Argh, broken: " + err.message);
}).then(function() {
  // Always hide the spinner
  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';
})

Try it

And there we have it (see code), a fully async version of the sync version. But we can do better. At the moment our page is downloading like this:

Browsers are pretty good at downloading multiple things at once, so we're losing performance by downloading chapters one after the other. What we want to do is download them all at the same time, then process them when they've all arrived. Thankfully there's an API for this:

Promise.all(arrayOfPromises).then(function(arrayOfResults) {
  //...
})

Promise.all takes an array of promises and creates a promise that fulfills when all of them successfully complete. You get an array of results (whatever the promises fulfilled to) in the same order as the promises you passed in.

getJSON('story.json').then(function(story) {
  addHtmlToPage(story.heading);

  // Take an array of promises and wait on them all
  return Promise.all(
    // Map our array of chapter urls to
    // an array of chapter json promises
    story.chapterUrls.map(getJSON)
  );
}).then(function(chapters) {
  // Now we have the chapters jsons in order! Loop through…
  chapters.forEach(function(chapter) {
    // …and add to the page
    addHtmlToPage(chapter.html);
  });
  addTextToPage("All done");
}).catch(function(err) {
  // catch any error that happened so far
  addTextToPage("Argh, broken: " + err.message);
}).then(function() {
  document.querySelector('.spinner').style.display = 'none';
})

*/

}())  // IIFE
